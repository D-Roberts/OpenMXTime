# GluonSpaceTime
The open source GluonSpaceTime repository contains the gluon-spaceTime project, an Apache MXNet Incubator and Gluon - based repository implementing architectures for spatio temporal problems (including time only or space only). 

Models for time series in either time or frequency domain are relevant, as well as models with a spatial component. Applications related to sound, trajectories, video recognition, human activity recognition, asset returns, demand forecasting, and other time-varying signals are relevant.

To get started, please see the quick_start and LorenzMap codes.

Dependencies
