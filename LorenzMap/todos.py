# TODO: format Pep 8 (look for arg alignment in mxnet code)

# TODO: test that all works at this point and push to git (local)

# TODO; sufficient to inquire


# TODO: understand exactly how is total loss, curernt loss and number of batches calculated
# Somehow the performance deteriorated after the changes.
# -------------------

# TODO: evaluate on GPU.



# --------------------

# TODO: evaluate if she reported tests on the param selection she says or on
# the setting she had in the code and used in my own tuning.

# TODO: rerun performances. Notice better with 200 epochs on z unconditional.
# TODO: recheck that the correct ts are predicted; seems weirdly the same performance and plot.
# seems that cw requires now 400 epochs or more to get a score higher than w. weird. test the
# other params for lorenz; and better perform for y traj. (0.002 or so)
